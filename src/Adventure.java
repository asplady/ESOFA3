/**  Adventure Game  Program Code
Copyright (c) 1999-2012 James M. Bieman
The Adventure game is based on the "Colossal Cave Adventure" originally
designed by Will Crowther and implemented by Will Crowther
and Don Wood in Fortran in 1975 and 1976.

This micro-version is a variant of the original cave system and is implemented in Java
with just a few rooms and with a much more limited vocabulary.

Updated August 2010, January 2012
- Code is put into package cs314.a2 to match current CS314 coding standards.
Updated January 2012
- Renamed as the "Adventure Game"

To compile: javac cs314.a2.AdventureGame.java
To run:     java cs314.a2.AdventureGame

The main routine is AdventureGame.main

/** class Adventure: Primary method, createCave, creates the cave system.
        It eventually be replaced with a more flexible mechanism
        to support input and output from devices other than
        an ASCII terminal.

		Room descriptions are followed by a room identifier,
		to ease debugging and testing.  These would be removed
		to help confuse the user, which is our ultimate aim.

		I haven't added all of the room descriptions.  They
		will be done later.
		
		In this version all I/O is through standard I/O;
		I/O is to and from the console.
